# Wideband-Power-Amplifier-design-in-UMC-65-nm
Wideband Power Amplifier design in UMC 65 nm project has been done as BTECH final year project at IIST. This PA has been designed at 28 GHz for 5G Applications with pre=layout results of 7+ GHz of bandwidth, around 10 dB of gain, 11 % of PAE with 1.5 V of power supply. 


This is a work done in Intenship and Final year project in BTECH at IIST. 

The work has been done using Cadance virtuoso tool and the UMC 65nm library file has been used for design which has not been uploaded here.
